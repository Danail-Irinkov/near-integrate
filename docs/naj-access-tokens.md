## Why do you need Access Tokens

Access tokens are required for any mutation of the blockchain, for ex. transfer, recording data, deploying contracts, minting NFTs, etc.

---

## Token Types

NEAR supports two types of Access Tokens:

- **Full Access (FA) Token** - Used to deploy contracts and anything that requires transfer of tokens between accounts.
- **Function Call (FC) Token** - Used to execute contract method calls without deposit.  
**The FC Token always has an allowance of 0.25 NEAR to spend on fees.**  
**The FC Token can only be used with the predefined Sender and Receiver**

## Custodians of FA Tokens

In the spirit of Web3 to only the owner of the wallet should have a copy of the FA key.  
If the key leaks, the account will most probably get compromised.  

Any applications that have access to this key are called ***Custodian***.  
Nearly all people will **avoid** ***Custodian Apps***, due to the **High Risks and Trust** required to use them.

## Token Specifications

The NEAR tokens use "Ed25519" encryption
Ed25519 is an elliptic curve signing algorithm using EdDSA and Curve25519
