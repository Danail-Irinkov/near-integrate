A NEAR Protocol Integration CheatSheet, 
built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org) 
and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
at [Github](https://github.com/Danail-Irinkov/near-integrate.git",)

## Why?

Reading all relevant docs and interpreting them to best practices,
could be difficult for any beginner :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

We will try to simplify the process by discussing the options.

## What's missing?

Examples for all coding languages. If you want to add examples with your favourite language, that would be Brilliant!

## Integrating NEAR

### Choose a method for communication with the NEAR Protocol
<center-content>
<near-button title="HTTP (RPC)" route="/docs/rpc-installation"></near-button>
<near-button title="NEAR-API-JS" route="/docs/naj-installation"></near-button>
</center-content>

### Hints:

> If you are unable to import an npm library(near-api-js) in your project,
you will have to develop your logic based on direct requests to the RPC.

> The core method to interact with NEAR is to post http requests to the NEAR RPC API:
https://docs.near.org/docs/api/rpc

> The easier method would be using
the official Javascript SDK 'near-api-js'
